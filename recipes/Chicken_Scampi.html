    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Move over shrimp scampi, thereâ€™s a new player in town! This chicken scampi is a quick meal, ready in less than 30 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parsley, or as needed for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in wine, reduce heat, and simmer until volume is reduced by half. Stir in lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, and crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, remove any tendons from chicken tenderloins. Season chicken with salt and Italian seasoning. Add chicken to sauce, cover skillet, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, turn chicken over, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water. Add pasta to sauce; toss to coat. If sauce is too thick for your taste, add reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to the sauce. Sprinkle with parsley to garnish. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
